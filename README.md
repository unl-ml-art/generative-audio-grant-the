# Project 2 Generative Audio

Grant Stoner gstoner2@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

Inspired by Johnny Cash's famous cover of "Hurt" by Nine Inch Nails, I wanted to use Jukebox to make a Nine Inch Nails cover of Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire".

## Model/Data

I used the Jukebox code example.

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Jupyter notebooks: Interacting_With_Jukebox.ipynb

## Results

audio-2.wav is the resulting audio file from what I input into the Jukebox Notebook. It's pretty chaotic, which I at first thought was a total failure. However, after thining about it some more, I realized that this track could easily be on a Nine Inch Nails album and would fit in for the most part.

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
