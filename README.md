# Project 2 Generative Audio

Grant Stoner gstoner2@huskers.unl.edu

## Abstract

Inspired by Johnny Cash's famous cover of "Hurt" by Nine Inch Nails, I wanted to use Jukebox to make a Nine Inch Nails version of some of Johnny Cash's songs.

## Model/Data

I used the Jukebox code example

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- `.wav` files or `.mp4`
- `.midi` files
- musical scores
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
